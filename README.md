## Mathematical_Pictures_at_a_Data_Science_Exhibition

     In Progress

This repository contains a collection of computational illustrations accompanying the book *Mathematical Pictures at a Data Science Exhibition*, to be published by Cambridge University Press.

The raw codes, available in MATLAB and in Python, are located inside the folders called "MATLAB" and "Python". For a more direct access to the illustrations, click on the links in the table of content below.

The illustrations were written by Simon Foucart and Chunyang Liao. Help from Tushar Pandey and Kung-Ching Lin was also welcome.

Reproducing the illustrations sometimes requires additional software to be installed: in MATLAB, CVX (http://cvxr.com/cvx/) is necessary, and in Python, CVXPY (https://www.cvxpy.org/) is necessary.
