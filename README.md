# Mathematical_Pictures_at_a_Data_Science_Exhibition

     ** In Progress ** 

This repository contains a collection of computational illustrations accompanying the book "Mathematical Pictures at a Data Science Exhibition", to be published by Cambridge University Press.

The raw codes, available in MATLAB and in Python, are located inside the folders called "MATLAB" and "Python". For a more direct access to the illustrations, click on the links below.

The illustrations were written by Simon Foucart, with extremely valuable help from Chunyang Liao. More isolated help from Tushar Pandey and Kung-Ching Lin was also welcome.

Reproducing some of the illustrations sometimes require additional software to be installed: in MATLAB, CVX (http://cvxr.com/cvx/) is necessary, and in Python, CVXPY (https://www.cvxpy.org/) is necessary.
